This repo presents a simplified method to setup Modelsim on Ubuntu. Just have to follow the steps given below.

The document attached as link with this readme presents a much simpler method for setting up modelsim on Ubuntu and 
also shows how to integrate modelsim with quartus.
A shell script file has been written by me ,I tested it on two Linux Macheines and it worked fine for me.
